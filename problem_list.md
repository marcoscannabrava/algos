- [ ] For a given array “X,” consisting of non-negative integer characters, write a code to find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum.
- [ ] For a given array “X” of size N-1 consisting of numbers from 1 to N with one number missing, write a code to find the missing number in the array.
- [ ] For a given set of 2 sorted arrays “X” and “Y” with respective sizes “n” and ‘m’, write a code to merge the two sorted arrays such that their characters appear in decreasing order.
- [ ] For a given set of 2 arrays “X” and “Y” consisting of positive integers, write a code to find the total no. of pairs to satisfy the condition x^y>y^x, where “x” is an element of array “X” and “y” is an element of array “Y.”
- [ ] For a given array “K,” where all the elements in the array are distinct, write a function to find the Kth smallest element where “K” is a number and is smaller than the array’s size.
- [ ] You’re given an array “X” of size “N,” containing sets of 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a program to sort the array elements in ascending order.
- [ ] For a given array “X” of N positive integers, write a function to return the value “True” if a particular triplet (a,b,c) accurately satisfies the condition: a^2+b^2=c^2 (this is commonly called the Pythagorean Triplet problem).
- [ ] If you’re given an array “X” comprising “n” positive integers, write a function to compute the inversion count of the array.
- [ ] You’re given two Linked Lists, “A” and “B,” that are sorted. Write a code to merge the two Linked Lists.
- [ ] Explain Longest Common Sequence and Longest Increasing Subsequence in dynamic programming.
- [ ] For a given Singly Linked List “K,” write a code to select a particular “random” node from the list.
- [ ] Explain the process to implement BFS and DFS in a given graph.
- [ ] Explain how to implement the functions “strstr” and “Atoi” by citing examples.
- [ ] Write a code to find the middle element in a given Linked List “K.”
- [ ] Write a program function to implement Loop Detection and Loop Removal in a given Linked List “K.”
- [ ] For a given string “K,” write a function to eliminate duplicates from the string.
- [ ] Write a program to find out if two given strings “A” and “B” of set sizes are anagrams of each other.
- [ ] For a given binary tree “BT”, convert it into a Doubly Linked List (DLL), using the left and right pointers in the nodes as the previous and subsequent pointers in the DLL.
- [ ] For a given Binary Search Tree with unique values and two node values, write a code to find the Lowest Common Ancestor of the two given nodes in the Binary Search Tree.

- [ ] For a given string “S,” write a function to compute the length of the longest substring that has only distinct characters.
